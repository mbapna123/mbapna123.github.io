Pokemon's photos get bigger with increasing size, have to compensate for that:

if (poke/human)>0;
and poke 10 times greater than human, have if be technically 10*.85 times bigger
since the photo will already be bigger. So if 1 have scaling factor be 1, 10 have scaling
factor be .85. Thus x=x*(-.01666667x+1.01667).
Same thing on opposite side,
